# ðŸ—¼ EIFFEL: Easy Indexer For Frickin EVM Logs

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is a simple Typescript indexer for any smart contract event logs on any EVM chain based soley on the contract ABI (no custom code needed to run but is extendable if you want). It saves event data into either postgres, MongoDB or SQLite (in-memory or file). Indexer comes with a REST API to query indexed data.

You just have to provide an RPC url (public works too!), chain ID and ABI of a target contract with address. No need to write any code or use any SDKs, archives or other bullshit.

## Deployment

### environment variables

In order to run the indexer you don't have to write any code. Every contract can be indexed just by providing a contract ABI and a target address. This indexer comes with an ABI parser CLI tool that can be used to generate a list of targets for indexer.

1. install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. run the ABI parser tool. **WARNING**: this tool only accepts Hardhat output ABI from `deployments` directory

   ```bash
   bun run create:targets -a <path to ABI file> -e <event names to index separated by space>
   ```

   example:

   ```bash
   bun run create:targets -a ./abi.json -e "Transfer" "Approval"
   ```

   This will generate a list of targets in a file `targets.json`.

   > If you want to index events from multiple contracts, then you can run the `create:targets` command multiple times with differend params and your events will be appended to the targets file.

   If you don't have Hardhat output ABI, then you can create `targets.json` file manually. It has a following structure:

   ```ts
   [
     {
       abiItem: {
         anonymous: false,
         inputs: [
           {
             indexed: false,
             internalType: 'address',
             name: 'addressInput',
             type: 'address',
           },
           {
             indexed: false,
             internalType: 'uint256',
             name: 'uintInput',
             type: 'uint256',
           },
         ],
         name: 'MyEventName',
         type: 'event',
       },
       address: '0x3a2Eb2622B4f10de9E78bd2057a0AB7a6F70B95F',
     },
   ];
   ```

3. fill in the environment variables in the docker compose file for the appropriate environment (dev or prod) or in the `.env` file in the root directory of the project if you don;t want to use docker:

   For indexer:

   - Required:

     ```bash
     CHAIN_ID=<number> e.g. 137
     CHAIN_RPC_URL=<string> e.g. https://polygon-rpc.com/
     START_FROM_BLOCK=<number> e.g. 0 to start from genesis block
     ```

   - Optional:

     ```bash
     BLOCK_CONFIRMATIONS: <number> default: 5
     BLOCK_FETCH_INTERVAL: <number> in miliseconds, default: 1000
     BLOCK_FETCH_BATCH_SIZE: <number> how many blocks should be fetched in a single batch request, default: 1000
     DB_TYPE: <'postgres' | 'sqlite'> default: 'sqlite'
     DB_URL: <string> for postgres it is a connection string, for sqlite it is a file name,  default: 'events.db' (for SQLite)
     CLEAR_DB: <boolean> clears the db before starting the indexer, usefull for development, default: false
     ```

   For API:

   ```bash
     CHAIN_ID=<number> e.g. 137
     API_PORT: <number> default 8080
     DB_TYPE: <'postgres' | 'sqlite'> default: 'sqlite'
     DB_URL: <string> for postgres it is a connection string, for SQLite it can be a path to the file or in-memory specifier ('memory') default: 'events.db' (for SQLite).
     GRAPHQL: <string> 'true' | 'false' - enables GraphQL API instead of rest
   ```

4. run docker compose for dev or prod environment or dev script:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.[env].yml up
   ```

   This will start the indexer and the API server. Dev docker file will autoreload the indexer and the API on every code change. Prod one is optimized for production - you just have to pass the environment variables to the container.

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

5. Enjoy indexed data with zero latency and no costs!

## Querying data

Event logs are saved to the `events` table and the indexed block number is saved in `indexing_status` table.

```ts
interface EventLog {
  address: string; // address of the source contract that emitted the event
  blockNumber: number;
  eventName: string;
  args: Record<string, any>; // event arguments in a JSON.stringify text
  chainId: number;
  transactionHash: string;
}

interface IndexingStatus {
  chainId: number;
  blockNumber: number;
}
```

You can query them with the following API endpoints:

- `/api/events` - returns all events
- `/api/indexing_status` - returns the latest indexed block number for a chain ID specified in the environment variables

Requests to the `/api/events` endpoint are configurable with following query parameters:

- filters (EQ, LT, LTE, GT, GTE, NEQ)
  - `/api/events?where=address:EQ:0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174&where=blockNumber:GT:NUM:48358310`
    OR
  - `/api/events?where=address:EQ:0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174,blockNumber:GT:NUM:48358310`
    OR
  - `/api/events?where=args_from:NEQ:0x25aB3Efd52e6470681CE037cD546Dc60726948D3,args_value:EQ:1053362095,blockNumber:GT:NUM:48358310`
- pagination (limit, offset)
  - `/api/events?limit=10&offset=10`
- sorting (numeric sorting and text sorting) over top level fields or event arguments (asc, desc)
  - `/api/events?sort=address:ASC`
  - `/api/events?sort=blockNumber:NUM:ASC`
  - `/api/events?sort=args_from:DESC`
  - `/api/events?sort=args_value:NUM:DESC`

There are two types of comparison: text and numeric. By default all values are compared by text. If you want to compare by number, then you have to specify the type of the field in the query parameter. For example, if you want to sort by block number, then you have to specify that it is a numeric field: `sort=blockNumber:NUM:ASC`. This also works for `where` filters e.g. `where=blockNumber:GT:NUM:48358310`.

If you have multiple `where` clauses, then you can separate them by a comma, for example:
`/api/events?where=address:EQ:0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174,blockNumber:GT:NUM:48358310`

## Custom API endpoints

You can create your own API endpoints by adding request handlers to the `src/api/endpoints` directory.
Request handler file has to `export default` a function with the following signature:

```ts
  async (request: Request, db: PersistenceObject<>): ResponseWithCors;
```

example `src/api/endpoints/custom-endpoint.ts` in postgres:

```ts
import { Knex } from 'knex';
import { PersistenceObject } from '../../types';
import { ResponseWithCors } from '../responseWithCors';

// you have access to the db and the request object
// WARNING: PersistanceObject is a generic type and it differs depending on what db you use.
// For example, for SQLite it's a "bun:sqlite" Database instance, for postgres it's Knex
// and for Mongo it's MongoClient
export default async (request: Request, db: PersistenceObject<Knex>) => {
  // you can use the request object to get query parameters, headers, etc.
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  const amount = +(searchParams.get('amount') ?? 0);

  // you can use the db to query the database
  const baseDb = db.getUnderlyingDataSource();
  const result = (await knex.raw(`SELECT 1 + ${amount} AS result`)).rows[0]
    .result as number;

  return new ResponseWithCors(
    JSON.stringify({
      result,
    }),
  );
};
```

Now, if you use docker, please restart the container. After that you should be able to access your endpoint at `/api/custom-endpoint`.

The same endpoint in SQLite (for reference):

```ts
import { PersistenceObject } from '../../types';
import { ResponseWithCors } from '../responseWithCors';
import Database from 'bun:sqlite';

export default async (request: Request, db: PersistenceObject<Database>) => {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);

  const amount = +(searchParams.get('amount') ?? 0);

  const dbObj = db.getUnderlyingDataSource();
  const result = (<any>dbObj.query(`SELECT 1 + ${amount} AS result`).get()).result;
  return new ResponseWithCors(
    JSON.stringify({
      result,
    }),
  );
};
```

> NOTE: File system based routing does not work with nested directories yet. It will be fixed in the future.

## GraphQL (NOT PRODUCTION READY)

If you want to use GraphQL endpoint, then you should send GraphQL queries to `POST /api/graphql`.

> **WARNING** There is currently a limitation to the GraphQL api: you cannot query by event arguments. This will be fixed in the future by providing an option to extend the GraphQL schema with custom types defined by user.

Example for events:

```graphql
query {
  events(
    where: [
      {
        field: "address"
        operator: EQ
        value: "0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174"
      }
    ]
    sort: [{ field: "address", direction: DESC, type: TEXT }]
    limit: 10
    offset: 20
  ) {
    id
    address
    blockNumber
    eventName
    args
    chainId
  }
}
```

For indexing status:

```graphql
query {
  indexing_status {
    blockNumber
    chainId
  }
}
```
